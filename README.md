This JavaScript file is a collection of simple yet essential functions that demonstrate basic programming logic and algorithmic thinking. 
It includes functions for **string manipulation**, **array operations**, and **mathematical calculations**. For strings, the `reverseString()` 
function reverses the input text by looping backward through each character, while `countChar()` counts the total number of characters in a given string, 
and a placeholder `capitalize()` function is intended to capitalize the first letter of each word in a sentence. In terms of arrays, the `minMax()` 
function identifies both the smallest and largest numbers in an array, `sumArray()` computes the total sum of all its elements, and `filterArr()` 
is designed to return elements that meet a specified condition. On the mathematical side, the `factorial()` function calculates the factorial of a number, `isPrime()` 
determines whether a number is prime, and `fibonacci()` generates a Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms. Together, these functions provide a strong foundation 
for learning control structures, loops, and conditionals in JavaScript.
